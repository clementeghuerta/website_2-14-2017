      <p class=""> <h4>About me</h4>I love UI design, visual design, and graphic design. Some of my greatest inspirations come from great User Interfaces like the one's seen from Facebook and Apple. I love creating infographics and clean designs.<br>

      I am currently a graphic design student at California State East Bay studying graphic design and concentrating on UI Design. Before this, I attended Academy of Art University where I learned many different skills such as how to storyboard, edit video, and illustrate in 2D and 3D.<br>

      I love designing mobile first, using wireframes, researching, using stylescapes, creating user paths, prototyping, and designing responsive web designs (RWD), coding with: HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript(jQuery), and using Zurb Foundation, Bootstrap, and WordPress. Also, I have a passion in creating application (app) designs, and I am currently studying Human Interface Guidelines (GUI), Material Design and Lightning Design System.<br>

      Lastly, I have great visual, written, and verbal communication skills. I am very detail-oriented, resourceful, and well-organized. And I work great in self-direction and am also a great team player. And, I have a great love for typography.
