  <p class="open-about side-container col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"><strong class="strong-about">About: </strong> Infographics are very fun to create and take much time and research. I believe that the main goal I set out to accomplish was accomplished.After a few weeks of research for each infographics, I wrote down ideas and sketched out possible ways of solving that problem.I decided to use three different data formats, which I think were used well for the type of data being showed to the reader.Each project took more than a month to complete and all together the projects tookjust over 3 months.
