            <p class="padding-10"><strong>Objective:</strong> Create paper styled user Interfaces<br>
            <strong>Process:</strong> <strong>conceptualizing</strong>I brainstormed ideas, which might benefit my portfolio, leading towards data visualization. <strong>Research</strong>For this project I used Human Interface Guideline and wrote down many notes. <strong> Ideas</strong> I wrote many thought and then kept the best in order to solve a problem I set for myself, which was to cross analyze 2 companies information.<strong>flow </strong> I then wrote down the flow I would be designing, which I cam back to before finalizing for design. <strong>Style Tile + other things </strong> I then create a sort of brand to go by, which I kept throughout the design and kept to the same color scheme and text size indicated from HIG. I read about Lightning Design System and worked with that in mind as well.<strong>Sketching + grid </strong> Sketching was done after writing down the flow and the grid was created with a sketch, somewhat and then finalized in illustrator.<strong>Designing </strong>I wanted the design to have much white space and a great user experience, so I mad the design clean and easy to follow.<strong>Prototyping</strong>This is a step I am currently on.
