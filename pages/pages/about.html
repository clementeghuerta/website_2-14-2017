    <p class="about-right-text">Apple is the wealthiest company in the world. It started in California in a Palo Alto garage. Steve Wosniac and Steve Jobs co-founded the first personal computer, which changed the world. Steve Wosniac had started a prototype from which Steve Jobs saw much potential in its uses as story goes. As the company and other competitors have grown, hardware has become stronger and linked to Moore’s law, which depicts that processors and/or computers become two times as powerful as 18 months prior.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-right-text">Powerful hardware and Apple’s great values in having beautiful user interfaces and design, has propelled Apple into the wealthiest company in the world. </p>
    <p class="about-right-text">My first introduction to Apple was when I was in grade school and played around with the 1998 iMac, which I had the pleasure of having at home later on. Later, I bought my first iPhone, which became the strongest tool I had ever had. This along with a background in art led me to think about a career in graphic design while in community college, which turned into a love for web design. As I learned more and more about web design, I noticed that graphic design could be a route to take in order to become a designer with many mediums(sort of). I then came across very well-written articles that involved user interfarce design, which is where I have concetrated most of my efforts.</p>
    <p class="about-right-text">Design is a great skill, which I aspire to be great at. And for that reason, I decided to create this Apple web inforgraphic to share with anyone else who may possibly enjoy a short history of Apple or who would like to know about my greatest inspiration.</p>
