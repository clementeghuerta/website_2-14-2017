            <p class="padding-10"><strong>Objective:</strong> Create clean and highly informative interfaces<br> <strong>Process:</strong><strong> concept and ideas:</strong> In this section of the process I conceptualized what I thought others like myself would like to learn about Apple. I had always wondered why their net worth is so high, so I thought to seek out why. <strong>Research:</strong> Research is alway a part of my design process and over the years I have gotten somewhat good at doing it. For this specific project, I mainly did stock related research and Apple tech specs reasearch also.<strong> Concept and layout of design:</strong> At this stage of the process, I sketched a couple of illustrations in thumnails 
            then at a larger scale with side notes of what I thought needed more information.<strong>Final touches on Rough Draft Input from Others:</strong> I find myself, at times, a bit stuck on how to proceed with perfecting and symplifying my ideas to show information as clear as possible. For this project, I asked an art director to look at it and give me pointers.<strong>Final Clean-up: </strong>As for many designers, the last step in any design is to perfect everything, by which I mean make sure you are following the grid and branding across your design.</p>
